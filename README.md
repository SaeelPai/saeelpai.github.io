## About Myself
I am a PhD student at Purdue University’s School of Mechanical Engineering, and am a part of the [Cooling Technologies Research Center](https://engineering.purdue.edu/CTRC/research/index.php), under the advisement of [Prof. Justin A. Weibel](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/People/ptProfile?resource_id=78578). I am interested in thermal sciences and fluid mechanics, and am presently working in the area of thermal management of electronic devices, which is the perfect confluence of my interests. I am also very interested in mathematics, and am working on using machine-learning techniques to enhance the design optimization processes of thermal management components for various electronic devices.

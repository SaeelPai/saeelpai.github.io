## Research Work
I work on the thermal management of electronic devices. For my PhD, I am working on designing highly optimal cold plate geometries. Cold plates are single-phase liquid cooling solutions used in high heat flux applications such as in data centers, electric vehicles, radar systems, etc. Although cold plates can be used in various applications, I am more focussed on the design of optimal cold plates for data center applications. This work leverages machine-learning methods to supplant traditional intuition-based design methods that require manual searching through a complex design space (boundary conditions and available surface morphologies), thereby enabling more optimal cold plate performance.

Till now, I have 
- Compiled an extensive database of fully developed Nusselt number and friction factor values of different constant cross section flow geometries (~800 distinct geometries).
- Developed machine learning based surrogate correlation for predicting the fully developed Nusselt number and friction factor of different constant cross section flow geometries.
- Used the surrogate correlations to find novel cross sections with desired properties.

Currently I am generating training data for heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics of three dimensionally varying flow geometries using automated numerical simulations.

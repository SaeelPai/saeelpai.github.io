  - Designed a novel forced convection heat sink by taking inspiration from Formula 1 cars, shark fins and human lungs, by exploiting the capabilities of metal 3D printing techniques.
  - Was designed on the concept of flushing heated air out midway through the heat sink and taking in fresh cool air through sidepods, much like F1 cars.
  - The predicted performnace was much better than the performance of conventially manufactured heat sinks.
  - The heat sink was manufactured by GE and the experimental performance was even better than the predicted performance.

### Thermal Management Strategies for Next Generation Smartwatches [[pdf](/ME511_report.pdf){:target="_blank"}]
*ME511 course project* \
Mentor: Justin A. Weibel
   
A new design for next-generation smartwatches, where not just the casing but also the belt is used to dissipate heat, was proposed and its performance was analyzed. Using a steady state analysis, it was shown that the proposed design has better thermal management capabilities than the existing devices. As compared to the peak power of 0.5W in the state-of-the-art smartwatches available today, the proposed design is able to sustain a continuous steady state operation at peak powers of about 1.65W, which is more than three times the maximum power in present devices.

The salient features of the new design are:
- **Watch belts as heat exchange surfaces** to increase the area from which natural convection takes place, cause in devices which rely on natural convection, the outer casing to ambient resistance is the major bottleneck.
- **Vapor chambers** for heat spreading inside the device.
- **PCM** inside the watch body to deal with the sudden burst of power during the frequent but short-lived awake state.

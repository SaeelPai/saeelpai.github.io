  - Designed a novel forced convection heat sink by taking inspiration from Formula 1 cars, shark fins and human lungs, by exploiting the capabilities of metal 3D printing techniques.
  - Was designed on the concept of flushing heated air out midway through the heat sink and taking in fresh cool air through sidepods, much like F1 cars.
  - The predicted performnace was much better than the performance of conventially manufactured heat sinks.
  - The heat sink was manufactured by GE and the experimental performance was even better than the predicted performance.
